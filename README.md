# Review GitHub users

On application launch, a list of random 10 GitHub users is shown. 
The list can be pulled down for another 10 GitHub users to be displayed (refresh). 
The list of latest users is stored at the Shared Preferences and replaced on each refresh.
By clicking on a user from the list, the user is presented with the list of its projects on GitHub. 
The user gets an alert if there is no internet connection available.
